# Statement

## Problem Statement
Heres a project that is simple yet engaging enough to demonstrate core concepts. Traditional chatbot examples often feel repetitive or overly complex for first‑semester learners. This project addresses the need for a lightweight, creative chatbot that showcases rule‑based responses, randomness, and multiple personas without requiring advanced algorithms.

## Scope of the Project
The project is scoped as a text‑based chatbot implemented in Python. It focuses on rule‑based responses triggered by keywords, with randomized outputs to make conversations feel less predictable. The chatbot introduces multiple fictional personas (Hibatron and Rosh2D2) to add variety and personality. 

## Target Users
- Educators who want simple examples to demonstrate chatbot concepts  
- Hobbyists interested in experimenting with conversational agents without complex setup  

## High‑Level Features
- Responds to greetings with randomized persona‑specific replies  
- Provides jokes on request, chosen randomly from a predefined list  
- Answers simple queries like “how are you” or “strongest robot”  
- Offers randomized fallback responses when input doesn’t match any rule  
- Supports multiple personas (Hibatron and Rosh2D2) for varied conversational styles  
- Easy to extend with new rules, responses, or even audio playback for recorded voices
